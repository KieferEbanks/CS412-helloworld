        <p>
            Hi! I am currently a junior at Boston University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Film & TV.
            I grew up in the Cayman Islands, surrounded by the ocean and amazing food! I have been a CA for both CS111
             and CS351 while at BU, and aim to become a software engineer after graduation.

                        I enjoy lifting weights and staying active. Besides just going to the gym, last semester, I ran a half marathon and this semester I am going to try a boxing.

                        I love watching movies and studying how stories are told on screen. I love analyzing and critiquing things especially, which is why I chose to pursue a Film & TV minor.

                        I really enjoy walking dogs for the humane society when I'm back home. As someone who never had a dog growing up, this is as close as I'll get to having one!
